- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @trisha-tran
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in honing my language skills by delving into unique projects either for practical (or impractical) uses
- My favorite type of math is Linear Algebra for teaching a much quicker way to solve systems of equations
- Disclaimer: I am a math person who likes to write mediocore code occasionally
